Game: Character moving around, collects coins for points, every 10 points is a new level. Touching the border removes 1 life. Can gain more lives by collecting crystal in the game - every 5 crystals is one life, and the amount of crystals you have is displayed next to the amount of hearts. The higher the level you reach, the more likely it is a wall will pop up in between you and the coin - it will always be larger than the distance between the player and the coin, so player has to go around it (you lose 1 life if you touch it), the faster you get and the smaller the coin gets. 10 levels till you win, but if you lose all your lives you have to restart from 1. The background of the game gradually goes from purple to yellow, and the status bar in the top fills up AND gets redder the higher the level gets.
